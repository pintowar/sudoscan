		<h1>Recognizer</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>31 December 2021</em></p>

	<p><div class="paragraph">
<p>Recognition is the process of extracting information from a known pattern. In Sudoscan context, a <strong>Recognizer</strong> is the "entity" responsible for recognizing the patterns in an image of a Sudoku cell. It uses an image as input and generates information if the cell is empty or the numerical information in it (if it is not empty).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process solves a very similar (and well-known) problem: Image Classification.
The goal of Image Classification is to classify a specific picture according to a set of possible categories. A classic example of image classification is the identification (recognition) of cats and dogs in a (set of) picture(s).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Sudoscan context, it is possible to use the same principle. However, instead of classifying an image into two categories (cats and dogs), it classifies an image into 9 different categories (a range of numbers between 1 and 9).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very common way to address this kind of problem is through the use of Machine Learning techniques. Even under the "Machine Learning Umbrella", there are several ways to solve those problems, like: K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deep learning is part of a broader family of Machine Learning methods based on Artificial Neural Networks. There are several ANN architectures that fits into this ML sub-category. One of those architectures is known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a very efficient architecture to handle Image Classification Problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several Open Source tools that help create an ANN. Due to its flexibility and ease of use, the chosen tool for generating (and training) a classification model using CNN for Sudoscan was <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A more detailed description of how the CNN model for Sudoscan was created and trained can be found on this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/pintowar/sudoscan-number-recognizer">Kaggle Notebook</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_keras_tensorflow_2">Keras &amp; Tensorflow 2</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keras is a deep learning API written in Python. According to <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> website:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow 2</a> is an end-to-end, open-source machine learning platform. You can think of it as an infrastructure layer for differentiable programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> is the high-level API of TensorFlow 2: an approachable, highly-productive interface for solving machine learning problems, with a focus on modern deep learning. It provides essential abstractions and building blocks for developing and shipping machine learning solutions with high iteration velocity.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned, the Keras API used to create and train the CNN model is written in Python. Meanwhile, the Sudoscan project was written in Kotlin, a JVM language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, an observable reader may wonder, "How is it possible to reuse code from different programming languages?". Well, at the time of writing this project, I found 2 projects that could help the reuse of a Keras trained models on the JVM, they are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#_deeplearning4j">Deeplearning4j</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#_djl">DJL</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sudoscan contains implementations for both projects. On both implementations, Sudoscan downloads the trained model from the Kaggle website and uses the project API to reuse the trained model (originally trained in Python).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sudoscan can use only one of the implementations per execution. The current implementation can be defined at compile time (the default implementation is the Deeplearning4j one). To learn more on how each implementation can be used, check <a href="https://github.com/pintowar/sudoscan#building-project">this link</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deeplearning4j">Deeplearning4j</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://deeplearning4j.konduit.ai/">Deeplearning4j</a> is a suite of tools for running deep learning on the JVM. It&#8217;s a framework that allows you to train models from java while interoperating with the python ecosystem through a mix of python execution via its cpython bindings, model import support, and interop with other runtimes such as tensorflow-java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see how Deeplearning4j was used on Sudoscan, checkout the <a href="https://github.com/pintowar/sudoscan/tree/master/sudoscan-recognizer-dl4j">sudoscan-recognizer-dl4j</a> submodule. This is a small module containing a <strong>Recognizer</strong> implementation that uses Deeplearning4j.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_djl">DJL</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://djl.ai/">Deep Java Library</a> is an open-source, high-level, engine-agnostic Java framework for deep learning. DJL is designed to be easy to get started with and simple to use for Java developers. DJL provides a native Java development experience and functions like any other regular Java library.</p>
