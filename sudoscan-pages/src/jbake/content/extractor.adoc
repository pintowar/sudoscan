Extractor and Plotter are both Sudoscan components responsibles to act on a given image. The Extractor is responsible to "parse" an image and generate a computational representation of the Sudoku Puzzle. While the plotter is responsible to draw the puzzle's solution back to the original image.

Both components dependens on *Image Processing* tasks. This is a process of transforming an image into a digital form and performing certain operations to get some useful information from it.

*OpenCV* is an open-source Image processing library that includes several hundreds of computer vision (CV) algorithms. It is essentially a C++ API, it can perform some real-time operations because it is very fast and lightweight.

Since *OpenCV* is a C++ API, it can't be used directly on JVM, however there are some projects that wraps its native interfaces. The chosen project chosen for Sudoscan was https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv[JavaCV].

*JavaCV* uses wrappers from the https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp[JavaCPP] of commonly used libraries by researchers in the field of computer vision and provides utility classes to make their functionality easier to use on the Java platform, including Android.

The most appealing reason to use *JavaCV* among all possible alternatives is the use of *JavaCPP* for packing native dependencies (binaries) for different platforms/architectures. To build an application using native binaries for a specific platform, it's just necessary to add an extra configuration during build time. For instance, the command `gradle -PjavacppPlatform=linux-x86_64 build` with only linux-x86_64 binaries on the generated artifact.

The code for both Extractor and Plotter can found be found on https://github.com/pintowar/sudoscan/tree/master/sudoscan-api[sudoscan-api] sub module.

== Extractor

As mentioned above, the Extractor is responsible to "parse" an image. For simplicity, let's assume the given image is the image below:

image::../sudoku01.jpg[Unsolved,320,align="center"]

The "parsing" process can be diveded into 4 different phases:

1. Pre-process image;
2. Puzzle detection and and frontal perspective;
3. Grids removal;
4. Cell split and content enhance.

These phases are decribed in more details on the sections below.

=== Pre-process image

The first step of the entire extraction process consists of simplify the given image. To achieve this state, a series of filter are applied to the image, they are:

* Convert to Grayscale: subsequent steps don’t rely on color;
* Blur the image: a gaussian blur is applied to reduce noise obtained in thresholding algorithm (adaptive thresholding);
* Apply Thresholding: separate an image into regions (or their contours), the process is called segmentation. Thresholding is a way to segment such regions;
* Invert colors: converts white into black and black into white;
* Dilation: the noise reduction of the applied Gaussian Blur shrinked the object. The dilation is a way to "revert" the shrinkage.

After appling those filters, the image should be transformed into this:

image::../sudoku02.jpg[Filtered,320,align="center"]

=== Puzzle detection and frontal perspective

After pre-process the image, it's time to detect the Sudoku Puzzle on the image. To find it, it was used the *OpenCv*'s `findContours` function. This function will find external contours (boundaries of shapes having the same intensity). The function will find a list of potential objects (polygons) that can be found on the image. However, it's assumed that the given image is focused on a Sudoku Puzzle, therefore the object with the largest area is selected.

With the largest polygon selected, it's time to crop it from the original image and transform the cropped image into a frontal perspective. To achieve the frontal perspective, it was used *OpenCv*'s `getPerspectiveTransform` and `warpPerspective` functions.

After those transformations, the image looks like:

image::../sudoku03.jpg[Perspective,320,align="center"]

=== Grids removal

Now is time to reduce the "noise" from the image, since the objective is to identify all cells content from the image (an empty cell or a numeric cell), the grids are extra visual information that's not important. That being said, it’s useful to get rid of the grid lines.

A structuring element is passed to `erode` and `dilate` in order clean up the grid lines. The function `findContours` is again used but this time with help of `approxPolyDP` to identify the vertical an horizontal lines. With an identified line, a thicker empty rectangle is drawn in order to override the line.

The resulting image of this phase is:

image::../sudoku04.jpg[NoGrids,320,align="center"]

=== Cell split and content enhance

At this point the initial image is completed prepared to be splitted. The image is divided into 81 (9x9) smaller smaller blocks. Every block is used to create a *SudokuCell*.

A *SudokuCell* is a computational reprsentation (a Kotlin class) of a Sudoku cell. This component is capable to identify is a cell is empty (in case at least 10% of total area of the cell has any content) and enhance it's content in case it's not empty.

Merging all cells together after the enchacement generates the following image:

image::../sudoku05.jpg[Enhanced,320,align="center"]

A set of *SudokuCell* is called a *PuzzleCells*. This component can generate a *Puzzle* representation with the help of a *Recognizer*.

== Plotter

While the Extractor uses an image to generate a computational representation (*Puzzle*), the Plotter generate an image from the computational representation, change it's perspective to the same of the original image and finally "paste" the result over the original image.

=== Generate the solution image

After the final solution is found by a *Solver*, the original empty cells are known numbers, With this information, a new image (withe the same size of the frontal perspective image) is generated with the new numbers found in the solution.

The solution image:

image::../sudoku06.jpg[Solved,320,align="center"]

=== Revert perspective

After the solution image is generated, it's perspective must change to "fit" the original perspective of the original image. Again, using *OpenCv*'s `getPerspectiveTransform` and `warpPerspective` functions, a transformed image is generated.

The reverted perspective of the solution image is:

image::../sudoku07.jpg[Solved,320,align="center"]

=== Overlapping solution

The last step of the plotting, consists in overlap the original image with the reverted perspective image. A simple use of *OpenCv*'s `bitwiseAnd` function can handle this operation.

Finally, the final solution can be viewed:
